# Is it a cat or a dog?

Using Neural networks, here we create a model that classifies the images between cats and dogs.

You can find the images used in this project here: [Catdog Project Images](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1s_gv6-cJzW6yFnacngtrYSho9hM9dBIh?usp=sharing)

Happy learning, and happy coding.
