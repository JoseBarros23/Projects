# Bank Loan Report - SQL Project

## Description

The **Bank Loan Report** project aims to monitor and assess our bank's lending activities and performance. This report provides valuable insights into key loan-related metrics and their changes over time, helping us make data-driven decisions, track the health of our loan portfolio, and identify trends that can inform our lending strategies.

This project is divided into two main folders:

1. **Dataset**: This folder contains the raw data used for generating the bank loan report. It includes information related to the bank's loan transactions, loan amounts, interest rates, repayment statuses, and other relevant loan details.

2. **Queries**: This folder includes SQL queries designed to analyze and generate reports based on the loan data. These queries will help us calculate important metrics, track loan performance, and provide insights into the overall health of the loan portfolio.
